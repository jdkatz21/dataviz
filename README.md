# dataviz

This is a collection of one-off data-visualization projects I have worked on.

**The creation of new knowledge is only as important as the dissemination of it.** To that end,
I like coming up with fun ways to visualize data, math, or economic concepts. The goal with this repository
is to give a jumping-off point if you want to make a fun visualization too. By posting these here,
I am creating a commitment mechanism for myself to write the best code possible.
